    "Create a method that processes text files in a folder to count how often certain characters appear. It starts by setting up a counter to keep track of character counts across all files. It then goes through each file in the folder, checking if it ends with .txt. For each text file, it reads the content using UTF-8 encoding and converts everything to uppercase. It removes any characters not in the list and looks for specific start and end markers to focus on the main content. If these markers are found, it keeps only the text between them. It counts the characters in this cleaned text and adds these counts to the total. Finally, it prints out the total counts for each character.\n",
